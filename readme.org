* Speed Demon
Runs internet connection speed checks for a specified interval and logs the results.

** Project aims
Allow a user to
1. Be confident that future functionality will not break current functionality (is fully tested)
2. Access great documentation
3. Easily extend the current project
4. Run a single terminal command to setup the project
5. Easily alter the default settings via command line options
6. Automate the speed testing to run at their preferred interval
7. Save results
8. Log cron errors
9. Log whether the speed test was done via a wireless or wired connection
10. Log time at which each speedtest was conducted
11. Log time when cron errors occurred

** Dependencies

*** Ruby gem
whenever

These gems can be installed to the system ruby (if using a rapsberrypi) or can be installed via rbenv.

*** Linux packages
speedtest-cli

** Hardware requirements
At least 1Ghz processor and 2Gb of RAM. (Overclocked Raspberrypi 1B)
These figures are hand wavy. 
However, on a non overclocked Raspberrypi 1 B, any CPU speed below 1GHz detrimentally affects that calculated speed. 
i.e the calculated speed will be less than that actual speed.

** Installation
1. git clone this project to a desired location
2. install the dependencies listed
3. call speed_demon from the command line with optional INSTALL_PATH and desired options
: speed_demon INSTALL_PATH [options]

or simply install to current directory with all defaults
: speed_demon 

4. enjoy
