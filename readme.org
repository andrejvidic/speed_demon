* Internet Speed Logger
Run internet connection speed checks for a specified interval and log the results out to csv.  

** Ruby Gem Dependencies 
whenever
speedtest-cli

These gems can be installed to the system ruby (if using a rapsberrypi) or can be installed via rbenv.
If you wish to use other ruby version managers then everything should still work provided you add the path location for the ruby version. 

** Hardware
At least 1Ghz processor and 2Gb of RAM. 
These figures are hand wavy however I have proven that any CPU speed below 1GHz affects that calculated speed. i.e the calculated speed will be less than that actual speed. 

** Installation
git clone this project to a desired location
install the ruby gem dependencies listed


** Output
For now all ouput is appended into a CSV file, which can be used for graphing and analysis.
